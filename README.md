Dash
====

For anyone stumbling on this, Dash was an iOS app that recommended good places to eat based on user location and social network. It was created in the summer of 2012 during an incubator at the [Yale Entreprenurial Institute](http://yei.yale.edu/). The app has since been taken down, but I've put the code up to show some examples of my past work.

Here is the promotional video my startup made about the app:
